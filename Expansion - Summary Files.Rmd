# Employment status and poverty status by disability, and employment, poverty, homeownership and housing cost burden by age

Use odds ratio to calculate disparities (see Matt Schroeder's helpful explanation below).

![Odds-ratio explanation](Images/Odds-ratio for disparities.png)

Calculate odds of those with 1+ disabilities being employed or at/above poverty relative to odds of those with no disabilities being employed or being at/above poverty.  Where odds of 1+ disabilities persons being employed (or being at/above poverty) are lower relative to odds of those with no disabilities being employed (at/above poverty), disparity is wider. For example, if odds of 1+ disabilities person being employed (relative to a no disabilities person) in Area 1 is 0.11 and odds are 0.56 in Area 2, disparity between the two groups is wider in Area 1.

Disparity and rank of disparity aren't calculated for age equity groups.  No "typical" or "accepted" reference group for age exists.

```{r}
# Employment and poverty status by disability
disability_ls <- purrr::map2(df_list, df_list_names, disability_vars)
disability_df <- bind_rows(disability_ls)

# Employment, poverty, homeownership by age, gross rent as a percentage of hh income in last 12 months (housing cost burden for renters) by age
# Monthly owner costs as a percentage of hh income in last 12 months (housing cost burden for homeowners) by age
age_ls <- purrr::map2(df_list, df_list_names, age_vars)
age_df <- bind_rows(age_ls)

sf_df <- rbind(disability_df, age_df)

write_csv(sf_df, "Expansion - Summary File Variables.csv")
```
